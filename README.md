------
To develop an advanced AI-driven ad creation platform for creators and SMBs that automates tasks like video content indexing, script generation, video editing, and multivariate ad testing, we can break down the system into key modules and design an architecture. The platform will rely on sophisticated AI models, NLP, and computer vision techniques to improve video content creation workflows.

Here’s a Python-based implementation plan covering each of the key components:
1. Video Content Indexing using Computer Vision (CV)

We need to build a video indexing system using computer vision to analyze and tag video segments, identify scenes, objects, and actions for easy retrieval.

For this, we can use pre-trained CNN models (like ResNet, EfficientNet, or ViT - Vision Transformer) to extract features from video frames and apply clustering for scene segmentation.

import cv2
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input

# Load ResNet model pre-trained on ImageNet
model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

def extract_frames_from_video(video_path):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    frames = []
    while(cap.isOpened()):
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        frames.append(frame)
    cap.release()
    return frames

def extract_features(frames):
    features = []
    for frame in frames:
        # Resize the frame to fit ResNet input shape
        resized_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (224, 224))
        img_array = img_to_array(resized_frame)
        img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
        img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)
        
        # Extract features
        feature = model.predict(img_array)
        features.append(feature)
    return np.array(features)

def segment_video_by_scenes(features, threshold=0.5):
    # Perform clustering based on feature similarity to identify different scenes
    # Here we use simple threshold-based segmentation for demo purposes
    scenes = []
    for i, feature in enumerate(features):
        if i == 0 or np.linalg.norm(feature - features[i-1]) > threshold:
            scenes.append(i)
    return scenes

2. AdGPT: NLP for Script Generation and Video Segment Matching

AdGPT will use advanced NLP models such as GPT-4 or BERT to generate ad scripts and recommend video segments. We’ll employ a fine-tuned model to understand the content and context of the video to match it with relevant scripts.

from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load pre-trained GPT-2 (or use a specialized fine-tuned model for ad content generation)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

def generate_ad_script(prompt, max_length=200):
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=1, no_repeat_ngram_size=2)
    script = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return script

# Example use
prompt = "Create a compelling ad script for a new fitness product"
ad_script = generate_ad_script(prompt)
print(ad_script)

3. Automated Video Editing using OpenCV and FFmpeg

For editing automation, we can leverage OpenCV for frame extraction and manipulation and FFmpeg for video encoding, merging, and output.

import subprocess
import cv2

def cut_video(video_path, start_time, end_time, output_path):
    command = [
        'ffmpeg', 
        '-ss', str(start_time), 
        '-i', video_path, 
        '-to', str(end_time), 
        '-c:v', 'libx264', 
        '-c:a', 'aac', 
        '-strict', 'experimental', 
        output_path
    ]
    subprocess.run(command)

def add_audio_to_video(video_path, audio_path, output_path):
    command = [
        'ffmpeg', 
        '-i', video_path, 
        '-i', audio_path, 
        '-c:v', 'copy', 
        '-c:a', 'aac', 
        '-strict', 'experimental', 
        output_path
    ]
    subprocess.run(command)

4. Voiceover Synthesis

For voiceover synthesis, you can use pre-trained models like Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), DeepVoice, or OpenAI's Whisper to generate high-quality voiceovers.

from gtts import gTTS
import os

def generate_voiceover(script, language='en'):
    tts = gTTS(text=script, lang=language, slow=False)
    audio_path = "voiceover.mp3"
    tts.save(audio_path)
    return audio_path

# Example usage
voiceover_path = generate_voiceover(ad_script)
print(f"Generated voiceover: {voiceover_path}")

5. Automated Captioning using Speech-to-Text (STT)

Use Whisper (by OpenAI) or other STT models to generate captions for videos.

import whisper

model = whisper.load_model("base")

def generate_captions(video_path):
    result = model.transcribe(video_path)
    captions = result['text']
    return captions

# Example usage
captions = generate_captions("video.mp4")
print(f"Generated captions: {captions}")

6. Cloud Integration and API Automation

Finally, integrate the system with Meta Business Suite and TikTok Ads API to automate ad uploads. You can use Python's requests library for API communication.

import requests

def upload_to_meta_ad_platform(access_token, video_path, caption):
    url = "https://graph-video.facebook.com/v12.0/{ad_account_id}/videos"
    files = {'file': open(video_path, 'rb')}
    params = {
        'access_token': access_token,
        'caption': caption
    }
    response = requests.post(url, files=files, params=params)
    return response.json()

def upload_to_tiktok_ad_platform(api_key, video_path, ad_title):
    url = "https://business-api.tiktok.com/media/upload/"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
    files = {'video': open(video_path, 'rb')}
    data = {'title': ad_title}
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files, data=data)
    return response.json()

7. Backend and Scalability

The backend can be implemented using a microservices architecture deployed on Docker and Kubernetes. The API-driven integration allows seamless communication between components, such as video processing, AI models, and cloud storage.

    Docker: Containerize each service (video processing, NLP models, etc.) for scalability.
    Kubernetes: Manage deployments, scaling, and orchestration of services in production.
    Serverless: For specific functions, like video processing or AI model inference, serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda) can reduce overhead.

Conclusion

The AI-driven ad creation platform involves several critical components, including computer vision for video indexing, transformer-based models like GPT for script generation, and automated video editing capabilities. This modular design, using cloud services, APIs, and deep learning, allows for scalable and efficient ad production. The use of containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) ensures that the platform can scale as demand grows.

This implementation plan provides the basic building blocks for each module. In a real-world scenario, you would need to expand and refine each component, optimize the models, and ensure robust API integration with platforms like Meta and TikTok.
